                            Choosing the right level and the amount of coaching is often a difficult task. The
                            confidence and enjoyment that children get out of tennis comes when they start to
                            feel they are mastering some of the skills. Our coaches love seeing children come
                            back time and time again, searching for free courts, and practicing tennis skills at
                            home. You don’t need a tennis court to practice, even ball tosses for your serve with
                            your less favoured arm is something that can be done at home.</p>

                            <p>All our juniors must join Karori United Tennis Club. As a junior they are entitled to
                            come to the Junior Night 5-30-7pm on a Friday night, which is a mixture of games
                            built around fun and developing skills, with the added bonus of a free BBQ sausage
                              in the middle of it. (We cater for vegetarians with vegetarian sausages as well).</p>
                          <h4>How much tennis should I do ?</h4>
                          <p>
                            Many parents will have read Open by Andre Agassi and may form a view that given
                            his success that is a guide to how much tennis should be played. Andre had to do a
                            million returns per year from the “rocket” (the ball machine his father engineered to
                            deliver balls at the same speed as many professional players serve now). That
                            meant that each day Andre had to do over 3000 returns.
                            CAPITAL COACHING DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS COACHING METHOD, and the
                              way Andre portrays it, nor did he.
                                                          <p>Tennis has to be fun, to keep interest and
                              enthusiasm up, and the level of training needs to be guided by the enthusiasm of the
                              junior. On occasions they might need a nudge, but we encourage parents to keep a
                              positive view on tennis and listen to the signs of fatigue and disinterest. Please
                              engage with the coach, they know how to help rekindle the interest.
                                                      </p>
                          <strong>We recommend:</strong>
                              <p>For novices who haven’t played before we recommend at least a squad per
                              week to start with, and coming to the junior club night on a Friday night
                              (5,30pm – 7pm) because it is free and works on skills. If the enthusiasm is
                                there, parents might also consider a private lesson to build technique;</p>

                              <p>For relative beginners and those who are little older children and with good
                              hand eye coordination we strongly recommend a squad and at least one term
                              of private lessons – to make sure they get the individual attention on their
                              grips and technique. We also recommend attending the junior club night.
                              </p>
                              <p>For the intermediate students we recommend two squads or one squad and a
                                private lesson per week.</p>

                          <p>For advance players we recommend two squads and one private per week.</p>

                          <strong>Capital Coaching provide three options</strong>
                              <p> Squads – a maximum of 7 students in 45- and 60-minute options. We
                              recommend that novice and beginner levels do 45-minute squads and by the
                              time they are aged 9-11, or are showing good advancement, they move to
                                hour-long sessions.</p>
                              <p>Private lessons – one-on-one lessons in 30-, 45-, and 60-minute options.
                              Shared Privates – we allow a shared option for same family or children of the
                              same aged (provided they line up the other player and we agree they are of
                                comparable ability).</p>

                            <p>
                          <h4>For junior coaching we provide coaching at various levels.</h4>
                              Wherever possible we target moving juniors from one grade to another over time and
                              to be with friends. Once juniors are moving into Intermediate and above it is far more
                              skills based. Unfortunately this runs a risk of not playing with close friends who may
                              not be at the same level (higher or lower). We offer six levels of coaching. </p>
